== Description
  Adds ACL support and door methods for the File class on Solaris.

== Installation
  gem install solaris-file

== Synopsis
  require 'solaris/file'
   
  file = 'some_file.txt'
  acl_text = "user::rw-,user:nobody:r--,group::r--,group:sys:r--,mask:r--,other:r--"
   
  File.trivial?(file) # => true (probably)
  File.acl_write_text(acl_text)
   
  # No longer a trivial file
  File.trivial?(file) # => false
  File.acl_read(file).each{ |acl| p acl }

  # Door file?
  File.door?("/var/run/syslog_door") # => true
  File.ftype("/var/run/syslog_door") # => 'door'

== Known Issues
  Although this libary uses FFI, the instance methods will probably not work
  when using JRuby because of the underlying use of file descriptors. However,
  the singleton methods should work.

== Future Plans
  Add acl_write methods that accept an array of ACLStruct's.
  Add support for extended file attributes.
